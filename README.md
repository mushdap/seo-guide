    A[Search Engine Crawler] --> B[Discovers URLs]
    B --> C[Follows Links]
    C --> D[Reads Content]
    D --> E[Analyzes Link Authority]

    G --> H[Stores in Database]
    H --> I[Indexer Processes Data]
    I --> J[Ranking Algorithm Applied]
    J --> K[Results Displayed in SERP]
```

### Critical Crawler Rules

#### URL Variations Treatment
- `https://example.com` ≠ `https://www.example.com`
- **Best Practice**: Use 301 redirects to consolidate versions
- **Avoid**: Multiple URL versions causing duplicate content

## SEO Writing: From Vague to Specific {#seo-writing}

### The Question-Based Writing Method

The foundation of effective SEO writing lies in eliminating vague statements by constantly asking questions.

**Core Principle**: Every sentence should answer: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How.

### 7-Version Improvement Example

#### Version 1: Vague (❌)
"Rohim is a very good player."
*Questions raised: What type of player? Who loves him? Why?*

#### Version 2: Still Vague (❌)
"Rohim is a very good football player everyone loves him."
*Questions raised: Very good based on what? Who loves him? Why?*

#### Version 3: Adding Specifics (✅)
"Last year Rohim played in the Dhaka City football game with national champions and scored four goals in the first 45 minutes."

#### Version 4: Location Specificity (✅)
"...everyone in Jailla area loves and respects him."

#### Version 5: Quantifiable Evidence (✅)
"Everyone in Jailla area funded him with 100K for his one-year expenses, and X person created a charity of 50K for him."

### Problem-Action-Result (PAR) Format

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Problem Identification] --> B[Specific Action Taken]
    B --> C[Measurable Result]
    
    style A fill:#ffcdd2
    style B fill:#fff3e0
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
```

#### Example Application:
❌ **Vague**: "I hired very high-quality technical people in my past."

✅ **Specific**: "Our SEO team were 67% inefficient on doing page schema for SEO. I created an assessment for schema training, which resulted in hiring specialists 88% better than the last 2 years."

### Quantification Framework

| Performance Level | Percentage Range |
|---|---|
| Very High | 87-98% |
| High | 83-86% |
| Medium High | 78-82% |
| Medium | 65-77% |
| Medium Low | 55-64% |
| Low | Below 33% |
